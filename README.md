# Rapid_Action

Our project is a simple game where a character is floating in space and there are random bars uprising. The user has to restrict the character from falling down or going up by moving one bar from another. At the same time he has to kill some enemy uprising from the bottom of the screen by shooting bullets. The user has to pass some levels and increase his score.
